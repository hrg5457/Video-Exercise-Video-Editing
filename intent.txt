In creating the video I saw there were distinct peaks in the music I chose, so I started lining clips up to the peaks and was very satisfied with the result. The overall mood of the video felt fitting for an environment type ad, so I adapted it to that. The video abruptly ends to grab the viewer's attention and envoke a sense of unease and severity.
